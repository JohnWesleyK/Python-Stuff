Problem 1
Create a generator that generates the squares of numbers up to some number N.
def gensquares(N):
    pass
for x in gensquares(10):
    print(x)
'''

'''
Solution:
def gensquares(N):
    for i in range(N):
        yield i**2
for x in gensquares(10):
    print(x)
    
'''

'''
Problem 2
Create a generator that yields "n" random numbers between a low and high number (that are inputs).
Note: Use the random library. For example:
import random
random.randint(1,10)
def rand_num(low,high,n):
    pass
    
for num in rand_num(1,10,12):
    print(num)
'''

'''
Solution:
import random
# print(random.randint(1,10))
def rand_num(low,high,n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield random.randint(low, high)
for num in rand_num(1,10,12):
    print(num)
'''

'''
Problem 3
Use the iter() function to convert the string below into an iterator:
s = 'hello'
#code here
'''

'''
Solution:
s = 'hello'
s_iter = iter('hello')
for i in range(len(s)):
    print(next(s_iter))
'''

'''
Problem 4
Explain a use case for a generator using a yield statement where you would not want to use a normal function with a return statement.
'''

'''
Solution:
*When you want to be memory-efficient
*If the output has the potential of taking up a large amount of memory and you only intend to iterate through it,
you would want to use a generator. (Multiple answers are acceptable here!)

Extra Credit!
Can you explain what gencomp is in the code below? (Note: We never covered this in lecture! You will have to do some Googling/Stack Overflowing!)
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
gencomp = (item for item in my_list if item > 3)
for item in gencomp:
    print(item)
